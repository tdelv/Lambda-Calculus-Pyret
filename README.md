# Lambda-Calculus-Pyret
A library of Lambda Calculus functions written in Pyret. Done with own designs (may be similar/same to online designs, but done without resources).

## Version Numbering
Version x.y depends on version x.{y - 1}; Version x.0 is a full restart.

 - Version 1.y was a first attempt without expectations for where I would go with it.
 - Version 2.y was created with the intention of trying out a typed lambda calculus with arbitrary precision float calculus.
 - Version 3.y will be focused on making a lazy programming language (with no explicit recursion!) and more exploration of programming language principles.

## To Run
Load in Lambda Calculus 1.0 code.pyret.org, or go to published version: 
[https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1AvIpFvj7t0wvb6w-f7072uTlPanmc8ul&v=bbf9214](https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1AvIpFvj7t0wvb6w-f7072uTlPanmc8ul&v=bbf9214 "Lambda Calculus by Thomas Del Vecchio")

## To use
Add `import shared-gdrive("Lambda Calculus", "1AvIpFvj7t0wvb6w-f7072uTlPanmc8ul") as L` to your Pyret program.

## To Do
 - Start v3.0 with no recursion!

## Bugs
 - None, but needs more testing
