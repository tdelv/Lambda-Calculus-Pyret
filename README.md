# Lambda-Calculus-Pyret
A library of Lambda Calculus functions written in Pyret. Done with own designs (may be similar/same to online designs, but done without resources).

## To Run
Load in code.pyret.org, or go to published version: 
[https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1AvIpFvj7t0wvb6w-f7072uTlPanmc8ul&v=bbf9214](https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1AvIpFvj7t0wvb6w-f7072uTlPanmc8ul&v=bbf9214 "Lambda Calculus by Thomas Del Vecchio")

## To use
Add `import shared-gdrive("Lambda Calculus", "1AvIpFvj7t0wvb6w-f7072uTlPanmc8ul") as L` to your Pyret program.

## To Do
- Add more functions
- Make more clear distinction of when thunks should be used
- Add negative numbers
- Add "type" annotation

## Bugs
